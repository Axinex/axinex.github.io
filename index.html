            <h1>Axinex</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Axinex, a materials science engineering student based out of the southwestern United States. I have recently began dabbling in the world of web development, focusing on simple, functional designs to provide a rich user experience without bloat or unnecessary nonsense. I try to follow a series of principles when handling any sort of development:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Keep it tidy. Bloat and flair have a place, but when it comes to developing websites and software, unnecessary flourish hampers a user's ability to quickly and easily get to the point of what they're trying to read, learn, or otherwise accomplish.</li>
                <li>Use any means necessary to improve readability. Add numerous and useful comments to your code and ensure that you dot your i's and cross your t's when it comes to a site's accessibility.</li>
                <li>Have a purpose for everything. This one is basically what it says on the tin: make sure everything you do and add serves a purpose, big or small.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
            <p>This site is very much a work in progress, and as such, is in a constant state of flux. One might find a page's content to be completely different from one day to the next</p>
